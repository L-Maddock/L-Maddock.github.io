This paper analyzes how Source-of-Income Protection (SOIP) policies affect low-income renters who use Housing Choice Vouchers (HCVs) to lease housing. In many localities, landlords can legally reject tenants solely due to the use of a public subsidy. Recent legislation aims to curtail such practices by labeling voucher holders‚Äô income as ‚Äúlawful source,‚Äù thereby restricting landlords‚Äô ability to discriminate. To study the consequences of these reforms, I assemble a panel of Continuums of Care (CoCs) spanning 2009‚Äì2018 and track staggered policy adoption across states, counties, and municipalities. Relying on a modern difference-in-differences framework that accounts for heterogeneous treatment timing, I estimate how SOIP adoption influences outcomes for households participating in the HCV program and households in the broader locality. Results from an intent-to-treat framework indicate that housing and neighborhood characteristics improve for HCV households after an SOIP policy is passed, but rental housing costs and homelessness increase for the entire area. One interpretation is that the policy improves outcomes for some voucher tenants but triggers offsetting housing provider decisions that adversely affect other low-income renters. These findings highlight how well-intended rules against source-of-income discrimination do not necessarily curb overall housing instability.

    Wetlands provide critical ecosystem services including flood regulation, water purification, and carbon storage, yet over one-third of global wetland area has been lost since 1970, while states lack consistent, spatially explicit valuations to inform conservation decisions. This paper develops the first national-scale framework for valuing inland wetland ecosystem services across all fifty states using machine learning-based benefit transfer. We implement a three-stage methodology: (1) stratified random sampling of National Wetlands Inventory polygons by Environmental Protection Agency Level III ecoregion, wetland type, and size class; (2) extraction of comprehensive ecological and socioeconomic covariates from wetland footprints and extended 50-km buffers, including climate trends, land-cover composition, human modification indices, soil properties, and species richness; and (3) training supervised machine learning models on the Ecosystem Service Valuation Database to predict per-hectare values while avoiding double-counting through rigorous classification of final versus intermediate services. Our framework generates the first fifty-state estimates of wetland ecosystem value at consistent resolution, demonstrating improved predictive accuracy and better capture of local heterogeneity compared to traditional transfer methods. These results provide states and federal agencies with a rigorous, transparent foundation for wetland conservation prioritization, mitigation banking, and ecosystem service accounting, while advancing the field by demonstrating how machine learning can enhance benefit transfer with scientific rigor.

    Following the Supreme Court's 2018 decision striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, mobile sports betting has rapidly expanded across the United States, with Americans wagering $121 billion in 2023 alone and industry revenue reaching $11 billion. Despite this explosive growth and mounting evidence of gambling-related financial harms, research on broader health and social consequences remains limited. This paper examines the causal effects of mobile sports betting legalization on physical and mental health outcomes using the staggered rollout of state legislation between 2018-2022. We employ the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) difference-in-differences estimator to analyze data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and American Community Survey, capturing health indicators, substance use patterns, and health insurance coverage across treated and control states. Our methodology accounts for time-heterogeneous treatment adoption and estimates group-time average treatment effects to assess both immediate and cumulative exposure impacts. Preliminary findings suggest significant associations between mobile betting legalization and several health outcomes, including increased substance use (tobacco) and worsened mental health indicators, though effects are attenuated when examining population-wide averages that include non-gamblers. The results contribute to growing evidence of sports betting's broader social costs beyond documented financial harms, informing ongoing policy debates about gambling regulation and public health protection in an era of rapid industry expansion.
