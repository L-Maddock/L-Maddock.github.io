# Welcome!

I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at Colorado State University, specializing in **homelessness, housing policy, and ecosystem service valuation**. My research utilizes causal inference and machine learning methods to understand how policy interventions affect vulnerable populations and ecosystem services. I am expecting to complete my final dissertation defense in Spring 2026.

## Currently on the 2025-26 Academic Job Market

I'm seeking positions in academic economics, policy research, and applied economics roles where I can contribute to evidence-based policy solutions. My job market paper, *Voucher Household Mobility and Rental Market Dynamics: Evidence from Source of Income Protection Laws*, can be found here.

## Research Focus

My primary fields of work are Public Economics, Environmental Economics, Urban Economics, and Econometrics. My research is primarily focused on the application of policy, where I attempt to use methods in causal inference and machine learning to explain social and environmental phenomena:

- **Housing & Homelessness**: Federal grant funding, tenant protection policies, and counting methods  
- **Environmental Economics**: Machine learning approaches to ecosystem service valuation  
- **Public Health**: Social impacts of sports betting legalization

I also maintain an R Shiny application that maps Continuum of Care boundaries and homelessness summary statistics, [found here at this link](http://qa38vl-lmad1997.shinyapps.io/coc-explorer).
