I am finishing my Ph.D. from [the Department of Economics](https://economics.colostate.edu/graduate/) at Colorado State University in Spring 2026. I completed my preliminary dissertation defense in Spring 2025. Prior to Colorado State, I earned my Master's in Science degree in Applied Economics with a concentration in mathematics from [Marquette University's Graduate School of Management.](https://www.marquette.edu/business/graduate/ms-applied-economics/) Before then, I earned my undergraduate degree in Economics from [Carthage College.](https://www.carthage.edu/academics/majors-minors/economics/). 

While at Colorado State, I worked as a Research Associate for [the National Wildlife Research Center](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/national-wildlife-programs/nwrc) as part of the USDA-APHIS from May 2023 until the end of my degree. Furthermore, I also worked as a Research Assistant for [CSU's Regional Economic Development Institute](https://csuredi.org/) during the Summer of 2022.

## Research Interests
My academic research focuses on policies and decisions surrounding homelessness, both directly and indirectly. This includes applying causal inference techniques to policies surrounding efforts to aid people experiencing homelessness and developing methods to understand the enurmeration of homelessness data better. With the National Wildlife Research Center, my work focused on developing tools to understand the monetary value of ecosystems and the services they provide through the application of machine learning, as well as assisting in the operation of field studies on the damage done to natural areas from feral swine. Certain papers of mine are under review at *Housing Economics*, *Contemporary Economic Policy*, and *Ecosystem Services*.
